LazyWrite is build to have the best compromise between a good page load and write a complex external data in your page (like Advertising).
This allow you to control when should those data start to render or load.

Advantages
* Increase highly the page load
* Stop freezing client navigator
* Forget iframe calls
* No other library required (like jQuery)
* No(or less) change of existing code

Example: Google AdSense
<script src="lazywrite.js"></script>
<script>
    google_ad_client = "ca-pub-5840687392233497";
    google_ad_slot = "9902234827";
    google_ad_width = 728;
    google_ad_height = 90;
    document.write('<script src="http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"><\/script>');
</script>
<script>$(document).ready(LazyWrite.process); // jQuery</script>
